     The space outside of or between, elements is what comprises of the margin areas. From the border outward of each element is the margin. In a website, spaces and sections between other elements, the header body and footer for example are controlled by margins.
     The padding is the area between inner elements like text and the border. The border will grow larger with padding. A border will continue to increase in size with more padding the text will say in the same place.
