      1. Version control allows developers to track changes and worktogether on the same project. Projects used to require lots of edits, and information would get lost between saves. With version control, all project information and progress is tracked in one place. This allows developers to become more free and adventurous with their code. Version control makes teamwork feasible.
      2. Git is a type of Version Control. Git runs through the terminal. It will notify the developer of any changes and the status of those changes.
      3. Github is a place where gits can be stored and developers can use their own gits to essentially make giant Gits on Github. Github is a "super git." It is the cloud for gits.
