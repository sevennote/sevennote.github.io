  <h1>Tech Issues - Net Neutrality</h1>

      Net Neutraility is a difficult issue, because the internet is not percieved by the government as a utility, like electricity or water, it is subject to jacked up rates and slower speeds. Because our internet service provider Comcast has a monopoly, internet in the United States is much slower and less affordable than other countries. Many people argue that if the government simply controlled the internet like the phone or television, the internet would run much faster and cost much less. Others fear government monitoring and control. These fears are justified considering the recent scandal at the NSA. The most ideal situation would be that a company with a more foward thinking reputation like Google took over internet acess like Google Fiber. However, if google had control over search email and internet service, they would be incredibly powerful. I don't know if we need the government to manage the internet, but we do need  reliable affordable internet for the United States so we can compete on a Global scale.
