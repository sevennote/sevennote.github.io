      It has been fun to pair with others on challenges. More so I have found that pairing provides me with programming insight I never had before. When I pair, I learn how to bond with other programers and get inside their head and methodology. I am a much better programmer from pair programming.

      Most of the time I feel good when I read my feedback a few times I felt bad. Those bad times though made me a better programmer, and much more professional durring pairing sessions.Sometimes I think there is too much feedback, but overall I think it is helpful.
