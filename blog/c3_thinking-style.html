      When I did the thinking style test I scored high in Concrete Random, Abstract Random and Concrete Sequential. All three scores were high.

    <p class="code">
      High Scores {



      Concrete Random: 52
      Abstract Random: 32

      Concrete Sequential: 40

    }

    <p>

    The lowest was linear sequential

   </p>

   <p class="code">
    Low Score {

    Linear Sequential: 12
    }



    </p>

      It made me think, you know I have the biggest problem in not understanding the content, but doing my work in a practical sequential manner. Indeed my biggest challenge has been organizing all the information at DBC. The things I find the hardest are writting the my reflections or keeping track the curriculum. I'd be the kind of kid in grade school that would forget to turn in his assignments, that couldn't take notes or write in a planner.
    I think at times the curriculum can be ambigous or the time spent on challenges are dispropotionately weighted and I fail to estimate getting everything done. Normally I'd prefer to just understand everything rather that doing the actual challenges or filling out work. The worst is getting stuck searching for something.
    In any field, It always seems that the easiest things that anyone can figure out are described well, and the harder things that are actually valuable to know, are described very poorly.

      The solution would be to look through the entire weeks curriculum and map out the course work. I will have to go to office hours more often to move faster through the work.
