      Modules are used to expand the capabilities of class and develop super classes. They also segeregate classes of the same name into modules.They allow for different inheritance patterns. Modules are used to expand the capabilities of an entire program and avoid redundancy. They are much more effective than saving the same files to a folder like in C programming.
