         Looping in ruby is a lot different that Javascript.

 Both use while and for loops. However, Ruby provides shortcut enumberable methods that are essentially while and for loops adapted to a specific task. In JavaScript the programer has to manually create these loops. Javascript is more like handcranking a tool as opposed to Ruby. In some ways I like learning how to hand crank things more. It gives me a better understanding of the enumerable methods. I'd like to understand the basis more in depth before using a shortcut.

        var even = function(a) {
    for (var idx = 0; idx < a.length; idx++) {
       if (a[idx] % 2 == 0) {
       console.log(a[idx])
       };
     };
  console.log(value)
 };
    </p>


      def even
        idx = 0
        while idx <= 10
        if idx % 2 == 0
          p idx
        end
        idx += 1
      end
