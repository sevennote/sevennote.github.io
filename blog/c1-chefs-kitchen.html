      Shereef's video was very down to earth and heart warming. I like how he reminded us that DevBootcamp is still an experiment. The concept of the Bootcamp is a social experiment. The concepts are revolutionary. That's why all of us as Phase-0 students are excited in the program. We have to avoid treating this like a college curriculum. This is a new concept subject to a lot of change and student input.
