      I choose creativity. I primarily went to DevBootcamp because I believe it will give me the insight to understand how greater projects in the tech world are developed from. Software development to marketing. Personally I've always been a creative person. I compose music on a daily basis, and have several other projects. I love comming up with ideas and I want to execute them.

      Advice: Someone recently asked me how to study DBC. I said reading the book helps. This comes hand in hand with growth.

I feel good when I think about my values. I don't have a stereotype threat will get in the way of it.
