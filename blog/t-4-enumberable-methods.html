  <h1>Enumberable Methods Group-by</h1>

    <p>
       Group by is an enumberable method that can take elements from a certain hash, organize and display them by certain properties. A good example would be.
    </p>
    <p><!-- insert text here -->
        list = {
  "apple" => 1,
  "banana" => 2,
  "pear" => 3
  }

puts list.group_by {|k,v| k == "apple"}
    </p>
    <p>
         The result will display.
          {true=>[["apple", 1]], false=>[["banana", 2], ["pear", 3]]}
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know how to use group other than display properties. I will see if I could use it for pushing specified groups into data sets. etc.
