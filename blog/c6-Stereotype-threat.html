  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

       Stereotype threat is a great problem in American society. Due to our conceptions of race and identity, we believe certain marginalized groups are incapabable of performing as well as others. Being of Jewish ancestry and religion, I have faced stereotypes through out my life. I have been forturnate that my group recieves a stereotype boost in academics as opposed to a sterotype threat.

      However, I believe education and research are not the answers to these problems. The problems are inherent in the academic institutions. If all information was opened sourced, and students studied in a similar version to our bootcamp, these socio-economic behaviors would start to dissolve. The institutions that make these arguments perpetuate stereotype threat.
